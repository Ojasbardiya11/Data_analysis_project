# Ref_score_project

Aim: Use available data to evaluate customers into Promoters, Passives or Detractors by modelling a score analogous to NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Both basic and advanced data insights are provided with the available data to better understand customer performance across various parameters.

We generate the Ref Score using the following models-
* Random Forest
* Multiple Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors

Taking the model which provides the highest accuracy, we then use that to evaluate other customers and classify them accordingly.
